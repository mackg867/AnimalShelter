    <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
    
<p>This webpage documents my work with regards to the Shelter Animal Outcomes Kaggle competition.  The following is the introduction
to the competition provided by Kaggle.</p>

<div style="font-family:chicago;margin-left:1em;">Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. 
Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. 
Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.
Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.  
We also believe this dataset can help us understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a new home.
</div>

<p>The data provided for the competition was split between a training set and a test set.  The training set identifies the outcome for each
observation while the test set does not.  Competitors are tasked with building a predictive model with the training set and then applying the model
to the test set.  Kaggle then scores the performance of the model and then posts the score on the leaderboard with the other competitors
submissions.</p>

    <h3><b>Data Munging</b></h3>
    
    <h4>Data Description</h4>
<p>Number of Training Observations: 26,729</p>
<p>Number of Test Observations: 11,456</p>

<h5>Independant Variable Definitions</h5>
<p><b>Name</b> - Lists the name of the animal.</p>
<p><b>DateTime</b> - No information is provided as to what the date/time signifies but for my analysis I assumed it was the date time
of the outcome.  Going off this assumption I did not include this variable in my model because we don't have any knowledge of when
an outcome will happen before it happens.</p>
<p><b>AnimalType</b> - Lists whether the animal is a cat or dog.</p>
<p><b>SexuponOutcome</b> - Describes whether the animal is male/female and if it has been neutured/spayed.</p>
<p><b>AgeuponOutcome</b> - Age of the animal when the outcome event happened.</p>
<p><b>Breed</b> - Lists the breed of the animal.</p>
<p><b>Color</b> - Lists the color of the animal.</p>

<h5>Dependant Variable Definitions</h5>
<p><b>OutcomeType</b> - Five possible values: Return to Owner, Euthanasia, Died, Transfer, Adoption.</p>
<p><b>OutcomeSubtype</b> - The competition only specified to predict type of outcome and not the subtype.  Given that subtype 
does not add any information useful for predictions I chose to ignore the subtype variable.</p>

<h5>Variable Transformations</h5>
<p>The code that performs the following transformations can be found in the Clean.R file.</p>

<p><b>Name</b> - Instead of using the acutal name of the animal I changed the variable to indicate whether the animal was given a
name or not.</p>
<p><b>SexuponOutcome</b> - This variable contains two peices of information.  The first peice describes whether the animal is male/female and the
other while the other describes whether the animal has been spayed/neutered.  I pulled out the Spayed/Neutered information into its 
own variable called IsFixed, where a value of "Yes" denotes that the animail has been spayed/neutered while "No" denotes the animail 
has been left intact.  I also pulled out the male/female information into its own variable called Sex that has the values of "Male" 
and "Female".  There was only one NA value within the SexuponOutcome variable.  I set this observation to be "Unknown".</p>
<p><b>AgeuponOutcome</b> - The AgeuponOutcome was originally given in terms of days, weeks, months, and years.  I modified the variable to be measured
in days and changed the name to be Age.  Any animals that did not have an age were given an age of zero, within the training data 
set there were 18 animals with no age.  Note, there were 22 animals with an age of 0 years.  For these animals I also made their age
0.</p>
<p><b>Breed</b> - In total there were 1,380 unique types of breeds listed in the data set.  To reduce the number of types to a more 
managable size I made two new variables.  The first is called MixBreed which describes whether the animal is a mix of two or more breeds. 
The other variable is called MainBreed which was created by taking the first breed listed in the mix.  For example, 
"Cardigan Welsh Corgi/Australian Cattle Dog" would be turned into "Cardigan Welsh Corgi".  After this transformation MainBreed only 
contains 68 unique breeds.</p>
<p><b>Color</b> - This was another variable that contained a lot of unique types.  There were 366 different types of colors listed 
in the data set.  To reduce this number down I used the same method as I did for Breed.  I created a new variable that described
whether the color was mixed called MixColor.  I also created a variable called MainColor that was created in the same way as 
MainBreed.</p>

    <h3><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b></h3>

<p>The following graphic was made using Tableau Public.  You are encourage to explore the different plots to see what patterns you can 
discover.  Notice that even though I did not inlcude the Date/Time variable in the predictive model I included 
it in some of the plots.  Including Date/Time allows you to see any trends in the data.  The first plot shows a seasonal trend to outcomes.  
There are many more outcomes during the summer months than the winter months.  If you further breakdown the data you will notice that 
this trend is solely due to the outcomes from cats.</p>

<p>Some other interesting things to note.  Dogs are more likely to be returned to their owner while cats are more likely to die.  
The most likely outcome for a cat is to be transfered while dogs are most likely to be adopted.  And an observation that will 
shock no one people tend to adopt younger animals, especailly kittens.</p>

    <h3><b>Modeling Procedure and Results</b></h3>
<p>For this problem I built 5 different predictive models.  They are listed below along with their overall accuracy on the hold sample.</p>
<p>Naive Bayes - 0.6034</p>
<p>Multinomial Logistic - 0.622</p>
<p>Random Forest - 0.631</p>
<p>Neural Net (2 Layers of 20 nodes each) - 0.6325</p>
<p>Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) - 0.635</p>
<br>
<p>Since the GBM performed the best on the hold out sample I used it as my submission to the Kaggle competition.  The following
table displays the true positive rate and the true negative rate for each outcome.  Notice that the model has trouble identifying
the outcomes of Died and Euthanasia which isn't too surprising since those outcomes have the lowest occurances in the data set.</p>
<table style="width:100%">
   <tr>
    <td> </td>
     <td>Adoption</td> 
     <td>Died</td>
     <td>Euthanasia</td>
     <td>Return to Owner</td>
     <td>Transfer</td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>True Positve Rate</td>
     <td>0.87</td> 
     <td>0</td>
     <td>0.04</td>
     <td>0.35</td>
     <td>0.65</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>True Negative Rate</td>
     <td>0.66</td> 
     <td>1.0</td>
     <td>1.0</td>
     <td>0.91</td>
     <td>0.87</td>
   </tr>
</table> 
<br>
<p>Although the GBM provides the best predictive performance on out of sample data it doesn't offer interprebality.  To gain a
better understanding between the independant variables and the outcomes I drilled further into the logistic model.  Since the 
point of this analysis is interpretability and not strictly performance I took only the top three occuring types for the variables 
MainColor and MainBreed.  All other types were rolled into the type of "Other".  The top three breeds are "Domestic Shorthair", 
"Chihuahua Shorthair", and "Pit Bull".  The top three colors were "Black", "White", and "Brown".  The following table lists the 
coefficients for the logistic model.</p>
<table style="width:100%">
   <tr>
    <td> </td>
     <td>Died</td>
     <td>Euthanasia</td>
     <td>Return to Owner</td>
     <td>Transfer</td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Intercept</td>
     <td>1.19</td> 
     <td>-0.72</td>
     <td>6.2</td>
     <td>1.3</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Name - Yes</td>
     <td>-0.72</td> 
     <td>-1.0</td>
     <td>1.7</td>
     <td>-0.7</td>
   </tr>

    <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
    
<p>This webpage documents my work with regards to the Shelter Animal Outcomes Kaggle competition.  The following is the introduction
to the competition provided by Kaggle.</p>

<div style="font-family:chicago;margin-left:1em;">Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. 
Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. 
Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.
Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.  
We also believe this dataset can help us understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a new home.
</div>

<p>The data provided for the competition was split between a training set and a test set.  The training set identifies the outcome for each
observation while the test set does not.  Competitors are tasked with building a predictive model with the training set and then applying the model
to the test set.  Kaggle then scores the performance of the model and then posts the score on the leaderboard with the other competitors
submissions.</p>

    <h3><b>Data Munging</b></h3>
    <h4>Data Description</h4>
<p>Number of Training Observations: 26,729</p>
<p>Number of Test Observations: 11,456</p>

<h5>Independant Variables</h5>
<p><b>Name</b> - Lists the name of the animal.</p>
<p><b>DateTime</b> - No information is provided as to what the date/time signifies but for my analysis I assumed it was the date time
of the outcome.</p>
<p><b>AnimalType</b> - Lists whether the animal is a cat or dog.</p>
<p><b>SexuponOutcome</b> - Describes whether the animal is male/female and if it has been neutured/spayed.</p>
<p><b>AgeuponOutcome</b> - Age of the animal when the outcome event happened.</p>
<p><b>Breed</b> - Lists the breed of the animal.</p>
<p><b>Color</b> - Lists the color of the animal.</p>

<h5>Dependant Variables</h5>
<p><b>OutcomeType</b> - Five possible values: Return to Owner, Euthanasia, Died, Transfer, Adoption.</p>
<p><b>OutcomeSubtype</b> - The competition only specified to predict type of outcome and not the subtype.  Given that subtype 
does not add any information useful for predictions I chose to ignore the subtype variable.</p>

<h5>Variable Transformations</h5>
<p>The code that performs the following transformations can be found in the Clean.R file.</p>
<p>GO THROUGH ALL THE TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE FILE AND TALK ABOUT THEM.</p>

    <h3><b>Background</b></h3>
    
<p>This webpage documents my work with regards to the Shelter Animal Outcomes Kaggle competition.  The following is the introduction
to the competition provided by Kaggle.</p>

<div style="font-family:chicago;margin-left:1em;">Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. 
Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. 
Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.
Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center, we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.  
We also believe this dataset can help us understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a new home.
</div>

<p>The data provided for the competition was split between a training set and a test set.  The training set identifies the outcome for each
observation while the test set does not.  Competitors are tasked with building a predictive model with the training set and then applying the model
to the test set.  Kaggle then scores the performance of the model and then posts the score on the leaderboard with the other competitors
submissions.</p>

    <h3><b>Data Munging</b></h3>
    
    <h4>Data Description</h4>
<p>Number of Training Observations: 26,729</p>
<p>Number of Test Observations: 11,456</p>

<h5>Independant Variable Definitions</h5>
<p><b>Name</b> - Lists the name of the animal.</p>
<p><b>DateTime</b> - No information is provided as to what the date/time signifies but for my analysis I assumed it was the date time
of the outcome.  Going off this assumption I did not include this variable in my model because we don't have any knowledge of when
an outcome will happen before it happens.</p>
<p><b>AnimalType</b> - Lists whether the animal is a cat or dog.</p>
<p><b>SexuponOutcome</b> - Describes whether the animal is male/female and if it has been neutured/spayed.</p>
<p><b>AgeuponOutcome</b> - Age of the animal when the outcome event happened.</p>
<p><b>Breed</b> - Lists the breed of the animal.</p>
<p><b>Color</b> - Lists the color of the animal.</p>

<h5>Dependant Variable Definitions</h5>
<p><b>OutcomeType</b> - Five possible values: Return to Owner, Euthanasia, Died, Transfer, Adoption.</p>
<p><b>OutcomeSubtype</b> - The competition only specified to predict type of outcome and not the subtype.  Given that subtype 
does not add any information useful for predictions I chose to ignore the subtype variable.</p>

<h5>Variable Transformations</h5>
<p>The code that performs the following transformations can be found in the Clean.R file.</p>

<p><b>Name</b> - Instead of using the acutal name of the animal I changed the variable to indicate whether the animal was given a
name or not.</p>
<p><b>SexuponOutcome</b> - This variable contains two peices of information.  The first peice describes whether the animal is male/female 
while the other describes whether the animal has been spayed/neutered.  I pulled out the Spayed/Neutered information into its 
own variable called IsFixed, where a value of "Yes" denotes that the animail has been spayed/neutered while "No" denotes the animal 
has been left intact.  I also pulled out the male/female information into its own variable called Sex that has the values of "Male" 
and "Female".  There was only one NA value within the SexuponOutcome variable.  I set this observation to be "Unknown".</p>
<p><b>AgeuponOutcome</b> - The AgeuponOutcome was originally given in terms of days, weeks, months, and years.  I modified the variable to be measured
in days and changed the name to be Age.  Any animals that did not have an age were given an age of zero, within the training data 
set there were 18 animals with no age.  Note, there were 22 animals with an age of 0 years.  For these animals I also made their age
0.</p>
<p><b>Breed</b> - In total there were 1,380 unique types of breeds listed in the data set.  To reduce the number of types to a more 
managable size I made two new variables.  The first is called MixBreed which describes whether the animal is a mix of two or more breeds. 
The other variable is called MainBreed which was created by taking the first breed listed in the mix.  For example, 
"Cardigan Welsh Corgi/Australian Cattle Dog" would be turned into "Cardigan Welsh Corgi".  After this transformation MainBreed only 
contains 68 unique breeds.</p>
<p><b>Color</b> - This was another variable that contained a lot of unique types.  There were 366 different types of colors listed 
in the data set.  To reduce this number down I used the same method as I did for Breed.  I created a new variable that described
whether the color was mixed called MixColor.  I also created a variable called MainColor that was created in the same way as 
MainBreed.</p>

    <h3><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b></h3>

<p>The following graphic was made using Tableau Public.  You are encourage to explore the different plots to see what patterns you can 
discover.  Notice that even though I did not inlcude the Date/Time variable in the predictive model I included 
it in some of the plots.  Including Date/Time allows you to see any trends in the data.  The first plot shows a seasonal trend to outcomes.  
There are many more outcomes during the summer months than the winter months.  If you further breakdown the data you will notice that 
this trend is solely due to the outcomes from cats.</p>

<p>Some other interesting things to note.  Dogs are more likely to be returned to their owner while cats are more likely to die.  
The most likely outcome for a cat is to be transfered while dogs are most likely to be adopted.  And an observation that will 
shock no one people tend to adopt younger animals, especailly kittens.</p>

    <h3><b>Modeling Procedure and Results</b></h3>
<p>For this problem I built 5 different predictive models.  They are listed below along with their overall accuracy on the hold sample.</p>
<p>Naive Bayes - 0.6034</p>
<p>Multinomial Logistic - 0.622</p>
<p>Random Forest - 0.631</p>
<p>Neural Net (2 Layers of 20 nodes each) - 0.6325</p>
<p>Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) - 0.635</p>

<p>Since the GBM performed the best on the hold out sample I used it as my submission to the Kaggle competition.  It gives a 58% 
increase in accuracy over just guessing the most common outcome.  Two months before the competition closes my submission placed in the 50 percentile.  
To gain insight into the behavior of the model I created the following table that displays the true positive rate and the true negative 
rate for each outcome.  Notice that the model has trouble identifying the outcomes of Died and Euthanasia which isn't too surprising since those 
outcomes have the lowest occurances in the data set.</p>
<table style="width:100%">
   <tr>
    <td> </td>
     <td>Adoption</td> 
     <td>Died</td>
     <td>Euthanasia</td>
     <td>Return to Owner</td>
     <td>Transfer</td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>True Positve Rate</td>
     <td>0.87</td> 
     <td>0</td>
     <td>0.04</td>
     <td>0.35</td>
     <td>0.65</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>True Negative Rate</td>
     <td>0.66</td> 
     <td>1.0</td>
     <td>1.0</td>
     <td>0.91</td>
     <td>0.87</td>
   </tr>
</table> 

<p>Although the GBM provides the best predictive performance on out of sample data it doesn't offer much in terms of 
interprebality.  To gain a better understanding between the independant variables and the outcomes you can use the 
coefficients of the logistic model.  For the sake of brevity I dropped the variables relating to color and breed.  
If I was doing a complete analysis I would include this information.  Below is a table of the coefficients of the model.</p>
<br>
<table style="width:100%">
   <tr>
    <td> </td>
     <td>Intercept</td>
     <td>Name Yes</td>
     <td>AnimalType Dog</td>
     <td>Age</td>
     <td>Sex Male</td>
     <td>Sex Unknown</td>
     <td>IsFixed Unknown</td>
     <td>IsFixed Yes</td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Died</td>
     <td>-0.71</td> 
     <td>-0.88</td>
     <td>-0.67</td>
     <td>0.00</td>
     <td>0.52</td>
     <td>6.2</td>
     <td>6.2</td>
     <td>-4.3</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Euthanasia</td>
     <td>0.58</td> 
     <td>-1.1</td>
     <td>0.23</td>
     <td>0.00</td>
     <td>0.43</td>
     <td>6.1</td>
     <td>6.1</td>
     <td>-3.9</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Return to Owner</td>
     <td>-2.1</td> 
     <td>1.7</td>
     <td>1.5</td>
     <td>0.00</td>
     <td>0.28</td>
     <td>6.1</td>
     <td>6.1</td>
     <td>-2.5</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Transfer</td>
     <td>2.7</td> 
     <td>-0.7</td>
     <td>-0.15</td>
     <td>0.00</td>
     <td>0.15</td>
     <td>6.2</td>
     <td>6.2</td>
     <td>-3.5</td>
   </tr>
</table> 
<br>
<p>Notice that there are only 4 outcomes displayed in the table  The reason for this is that the fifth one (Adoption) is used as a 
baseline for the other outcomes.  The coefficients for the variables used in the model describe how the probability of being in 
the specified variable changes as it relates to Adoption.  For example, the coefficient for the AnimalType Dog indicator variable 
is -.67 for the outcome of Died.  Since the coefficient is negative this means that the probablity of dying decreases if the animal is 
a dog.  Conversely, if a coefficient is positive then the probability increases for that variable for the given outcome.  You can perform 
some simple algebra on the coefficients to determine the acutal change in probablity due to a factor, but sometimes it's enough to 
know how the probability will change.  One way to determine how the independant variables affect a specific outcome is to transform the 
dependant variable into a binary outcome. I did this for the outcome of Euthanasia. After the transformation the OutcomeType variable is made 
of two outcomes, either Euthanasia or NotEuthanasia. The resulting model coefficients are as follows.</p>
<br>
<table>
   <tr>
     <td> </td>
     <td>Intercept</td>  
     <td>Name Yes</td>
     <td>AnimalType Dog</td>
     <td>Age</td>
     <td>Sex Male</td>
     <td>Sex Unknown</td>
     <td>IsFixed Unknown</td>
     <td>IsFixed Yes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Euthanasia</td>
     <td>-2.2</td>  
     <td>-0.84</td>
     <td>0.18</td> 
     <td>0.00</td> 
     <td>0.24</td>  
     <td>-0.13</td>
     <td>-0.13</td>
     <td>-1.5</td>
   </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>Another way to determine variable importance is to use the random forest model.  R tracks the importance of independant variables 
during the model building process.  Once finished, it gives you a plot that shows which variables were most important for prediction. 
The plot below shows which of the variables used in the animal shleter data is most important.  The larger the MeanDecreaseGini the 
better the variable is for prediction.  Notice that Age is listed as the second most useful variable for prediction but the coefficient 
for Age in the multinomial model was esstientailly 0, which suggests that the variable is not important.  Remember that Age was 
measured in days and therefore the coefficient is related to the change in probability <b>per day</b>.  For interpretation reasons 
it would probably be useful to measure Age in years so that the coefficient becomes more meaningful. </p>

<h5>Conditonal Relationships versus Causul Relationships</h5>
<p>A quick note on conditional relationships versus causul relationships.  From the summaries of the models you can see that if  
an animal is fixed then their chances of being adopted increase.  Since this fact is coming from the models it represents a 
conditional relationship, the probability of adoption <b>given</b> the animal has been fixed is higher then the probability 
of being adopted in general.  But this does not necessarily mean there is a causul relationship between getting fixed and being adopted.  
A superficail analysis would lead you to believe that in order to increase adoptions you should fix animals beforehand.  
And it does seem very reasonable that if an animal has already been fixed that people are more likely to adopt them since this reduces the 
cost of ownership.  Although I can imagine a scenario where midway through the data collection process the animal shelter required 
that before an animal be adopted they must be fixed.  A situation such as this would show a relationship between getting fixed and 
being adopted but you couldn't necessarily say that fixing an animal increases their chances of being adopted.  
Further analysis on how the data was collected and how the animal shelter is run before any conclusive casual relationships can be made.</p>
